1. The three original input bipartite networks are:

- lncRNA-disease.csv
- lncRNA-microRNA.csv
- microRNA-disease.csv

2. The **Global_M-L-D_network.txt** and **item_index.txt** are the constructed heterogeneous tripartite network.

3. The **embeddings.txt** contains the feature vector of each biomedical entity calculated by [DeepWalk](https://github.com/phanein/deepwalk). 

4. The **lncRNA-disease-prediction.csv** contains prediction results.

5. The 5-fold cross validation associated data are in **data-partition** directory.
